-----ARRAYS------

8. 
a)develop an application to store N no. of cities into an array and find out vowel count in each city
b)develop an application to store 6 sub student marks and find out the student passed or not
	if passed, find he is FIRST or SECOND or THIRD division
	FIRST  - 80 to 100 percent
	SECOND - 60-79 percent
	THIRD  - 40-59 peccent
	FAILED - lessthan 40

9.
a) There are some N no. of oil pots with some amount of oil in each pot.And you will fill each pot for 
5 times with the same amt of oil(say 4 ml or 8 ml) and remove a pot if the amt of oil in a pot equals to
pouring amt.If a pot is removed, then shift other pots on the left side.
Finally print the pots available withamts of oil them.

10. Develop an appln to accept 5 students marks (each student has 6 subjects) and store  them into an array and
 find out how many are passes and howmany failed.
pass mark is 40% and above
fail mark is less than 40%
Note: student should get 40% in each subject to pass (min)
	pass cny : 3
	fail cnt : 2

4.open-up(open all the boxes to see kids)
5.exit
NOTE:IMPLEMENT USING ARRAYS

---FUNCTIONS N METHODS---

14. develop an appn to find count of a letter in a city name.
-create a method that accepts cityName and letterToFind
-implement logic in that method to count that a letter is appeared in city how many times no. of times.
for eg: city="Hyderabad" letterToFind=a'
	   letter 'a' appeared in city 2 times

project name(Leave the first and last letters as they are) and return the projects as an array.
For eg:-String projects[]={“BCMIS”,”DMCIK”,”PSTIM”,”VCIST”};
Output:
BIMCS
DICMK
PITSM
VSICT

20. develop an appn to fin


21.Develop an appn to perform banking transactions for a customer
-create  a class account with the below properties: accNo, name balance, branch
-ad da constructor to initialize an account object for a customer
-add business method to perform deposit operation

NOTE: business method (or)operational method


22. 2. Develop an application to perform the following operation:
 
A) create a class bike with properties:licences no., name,model price,owner
B) add a constructor with no arguments
C) add setter methods for all properties
D) add getter methods for all fields
E) add a method to return all bike properties as a string 
F) create a Main Class,in which,create bike object,set properties 
by calling setter methods,and print bike details using getter methods.

23. develop an appn to perform banking transactions for a customer and should be performed in a dynamic way:
----welcome to ABC bank----
1. create account
2.view account
3.deposit amount
4.withdraw amount
5.transfer amount
6.check balance
7.exit

24.(appn to make use of static, non-static, constructors)
 Assume that as a developer you need to develop an appn for ABC bank to provide bank accnt for their customers.
-each account should have the details like:accNo, holdername, amount, ageOfHolder, rateOfInterest. bankName, accountStatus
-create a business method that can generate N no. of accnt objects and return as array, based on request for N accounts.

points to remember::
1.every account will have same bankName
2.rateOfInterest for each account is based on age of account holder.
-16>age<25::2 percent ROI
-25>age<50::3 percent ROI
-age>50   ::4 percent ROI
